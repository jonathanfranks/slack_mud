FOREST {...You're in a dark forest.  Tall, ominous pine trees surround you, their
thick, bristly branches hanging down and making it difficult to proceed in
any direction.  Almost all of the sunlight is blocked out by the densely
packed trees, and the few rays which do filter down create dark, menacing
shadows which seem to dance along the leafy forest floor.  As you glance
around, this location appears to be very similar to the rest of the forest,
making it confusing to determine your exact location.
} T Kyrandia locations text


DTPASS {...You're in a dark, twisting cavern.  Everything around you is complete and
total darkness, making it impossible to determine any of the features of this
twisting passageway.  From somewhere above, tiny drops of water fall upon your
head, and the air is particularly humid.  The ground feels solid underneath
your feet, although extremely broken and rocky, and due to the solid darkness,
you cannot see in which directions you can go.
} T Kyrandia locations text


GOLDEN {...You're in a golden forest.  You are surrounded by tall, shimmering golden
elm trees, their breathtaking golden branches and leaves scintillating in the
sunlight.  Although formed of solid gold, the trees still appear to be living
in full bloom, swaying enchantingly in the gentle breezes of this wonderful
paradise.  A feeling of eternal love swells within your soul, as though this
is the heaven you've always wished to spend your life in forever.  The trees
blocks most of your view with their sparkling beauty, but you can move off in
any direction.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD000 {...You're near a mystical willow tree.  Before you rises the mysterious,
eerie silhouette of a willow tree, the most strange and fascinating of all
of the natural magic of Kyrandia.  Although willows are normally associated
with death and sorrow, this particular tree is unusual, as it radiates an
extremely powerful aura of good -- a miracle of the hailed Goddess Tashanna.
A small, dirt path winds off to the north, and dark forest surrounds you in
all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD001 {...You're on a north/south path.  Surrounded by tall, ominous pine trees,
you're located on a narrow dirt path which twists off to the north and south.
Dark forest leads off to the east and west sides of this little road, which
extends beyond your vision into dark undergrowth.  Somewhere nearby you hear
the chirping of a songbird singing a faintly familiar romantic melody.  The
unmistakable aroma of blooming roses also hangs in the air, although you
cannot see its origin.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD002 {...You're at a "T" intersection on a path.  In a small clearing of the dark
forest here a narrow north/south path intersects with a smooth road that leads
off to the east.  Although it seems the road may have at one time extended
further to the west, it has long since been overgrown by dark forest.  The
sunlight seems particularly bright here, especially in contrast to the dark
forest which surrounds you.  For some unknown reason, as you look around,
memories run through your mind of long lost love.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD003 {...You're on an overgrown path.  Thick, ugly-looking bushes have crowded
over whatever road used to continue from here.  Particularly nasty thorn
bushes and twisting, spiny vines discourage you from digging through this
wild overgrowth.  Several annoying gnats swarm about you as you examine this
chaos of nature, biting painfully at your face and neck.  The heat and
humidity of this particular location brings a sweat to your forehead, almost
as though magically induced.  An intersection of several paths is just off
to the south, and dark forest surrounds you in all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD004 {...You're on an east/west road.  Cleared through the thick forest, apparently
ages ago, this smooth dirt road shows signs of frequent and recent use.  To
the east, the road leads to a village in the distance, as well as winding off
through the dark forest to the west.  Tall, majestic oak trees line the road
to the north and south, guarding the border of the extensive dark forest.  As
you glance around, you notice the word "zennyra" written in the middle of the
road.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD005 {...You're on the outskirts of a village.  Before you lies a high wall of
large oak logs, carved to deadly, pointed pinnacles at the top.  A thin
column of smoke rises from beyond the wall, along with the odor of cooking
food and other strange smells.  This is apparently one of the few dwellings
of human inhabitants within the Great Forest of Kyrandia.  An entrance into
the villages is to the east, a path winds off to the west, and dark forest
lies in all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD006 {...You're in the village square.  Located directly within the village gates,
this well-kept plaza has been landscaped with tall, beautiful oak trees, lush,
green hedges, and splendid assortments of flowers.  Various paths, all in good
condition, lead off in all directions.  To the north is a small hut with smoke
rising from it, to the south lies a intriguing, little shop, to the east is
the village temple, and a path leading out into the forest is to the west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD007 {...You're at the village temple.  Columns constructed from flawless marble
and arranged in a closely-knit, circular pattern establish this place as the
center of the village's religious rites.  Several small elm trees border the
circumference of this temple, and the interior is laden with numerous
lavender roses bushes, in brilliant, full bloom.  In the center of this holy
outdoors dagoba rests a sunken, marble altar.  A small shanty lies to the
south and paths lead off to the north and west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD008 {...You're at the gem cutter's hut.  This quaint, little hut has been built
from assorted branches of the forest bound together by dried vines, and all
twisted and weaved together into a miraculously stable bungalow.  A column
of smoke rises smoothly from a miniature chimney, and strange, spicy odors
float from within its walls.  Sitting outside, directly in front of you, is
a haggard, old man.  A path winding off to the south leads to the village
square.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD009 {...You're at the spell shop.  Well-built from attractive redwood, truly a
rare wood in these parts, this mystical hutch is labeled by a charming, purple
sign.  Standing before you is a strangely dressed man who smiles and nods at
you kindly.  A tingle runs down the back of your neck and you suddenly feel
the urge to spend large amounts of gold.  A small path winds off to the north
to the village square.  Your eyes seem to drift towards the sign.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD010 {...You're at the healer's abode.  Covered in a layer of purple mists, this
marble shrine is the abode of a kind and gentle healer.  Not only amiable,
the healer who stands before you is also beautiful.  She smiles at you
sympathetically, and mouths the words "For a donation, I'll gladly tend to
all your needs...".  Suddenly, you do feel a little feverish and the need
for some medical attention.  The temple lies to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD011 {...You're at the wise man's shanty.  This dirty, run-down, and odorous piece
of shelter is home to a lonely, eccentric miser who happens to be the wisest
wise man in the land, although not the friendliest.  He is standing just a
little off to your right with his hand stretched out, perhaps in greetings,
perhaps for gold.  He grins at you impishly and spits a large glob of some
disgusting substance which you neither recognize nor care to recognize.  The
only escape seems to be the temple to the north.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD012 {...You're at a bubbling brook.  Twisting its way through the terrain of
the forest, this sparkling stream of fresh water has surfaced from the depths
of the forest undergrowth to the east to flow visibly along a rocky bed for
a short distance.  However, it once again winds through the heavy vegetation
to become hidden as it flows off to the west.  From the sunlight which filters
through the dense forest around you, you occasionally see brief, golden
glitters within the brook.  Dark forest continues in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD013 {...You're in the Vale of the Butterflies.  Truly a paradise in reality,
this magnificent natural beauty is a wonder to behold.  Flowers of all
varieties, colors, and scents bloom majestically, creating a regal hall
of nature.  Yet even more resplendent and marvelous are the hundreds of
thousands of florid and exotic butterflies which sail all around you, carried
by the gentle breezes of the forest.  Dark forest lies in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD014 {...You're in a glade of pines.  Swaying back and forth in the gentle breezes
of the forest, several clumps of pine trees thrive in this darkened glade.
The ground is littered with millions of fallen pine needles, creating a spongy
bed on the forest floor.  You also notice several pinecones dangling from
the trees, some within your reach, although the wind keeps the tree branches
in motion.  The eerie whistling of the wind through the boughs above you sends
a shiver down your spine.  Dark forest lies in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD015 {...You're in a small, lush valley.  This fertile dish of the forest is a
little below sea level, and as a result the air is sultry and the ground is
wet with the remnants of previous rainfalls.  Several tiny, pink flowers have
sprouted amongst the heavy, green undergrowth, adding a touch of color and
light to this mass of thriving vegetation.  Dark forest continues off in all
directions, endlessly.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD016 {...You're in a dead wooded glade.  Merely a clump of old, leafless, and
rotting fir trees.  Whatever pestilence caused their death, its evil seems
to linger in the air and the ghostly fingers of the barren branches almost
seem to reach out for you, beckoning you to your death.  An icy wind blows
across your face and whistles harrowingly through the dead limbs.  Something
about this location fills your soul with fear, and your heart beats faster
as you glance around in terror of this unknown evil.  Dark forest lies off
in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD017 {...You're at an ancient grave.  Eerie white mists float hauntingly around
a slab of marble with strange etchings carved into its polished surface.
You hear the spine-tingling shriek of an owl somewhere high above in the midst
of the dark branches of the surrounding ash trees.  A cold, biting wind nips
at your face and you feel as though someone, or something, is watching your
every move intensely.  Dark forest lies off in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD018 {...You're near a hollow stump.  Protruding from the dense undergrowth of the
forest, this decrepit and decaying stump has been hollowed out by time and
nature.  Although you cannot see through the darkness of the stump, you can
smell a putrid odor of unimaginable origin.  You hear the faint rush of
running water off to the north and dark forest surrounds you in all
directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD019 {...You're at a flaming thicket.  Radiating intense energy, this blazing
natural inferno glows a deep red as its orange tongues of fire lash out
at you aggressively.  Although you can feel the destructive power of this
conflagration, it doesn't seem to spread beyond the thicket and, even more
surprisingly, the thicket appears perfectly intact and unharmed.  The sporadic
crackles of the fire make you jump.  Dark forest lies off in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD020 {...You're at the Tree of Rubies.  This glittering tree of magic is covered
with big, beautiful, and shining rubies which seem to be begging to be plucked
from their branches.  However, you also hear several strange hissing sounds
coming from within the dark recesses this tree's lush, green leaves.  For some
strange reason, as you glance around, a vision appears in your mind of a
beautiful woman who is concealing a dagger for which to slay her lover.  The
vision vanishes as quickly as it had appeared, leaving you wondering about the
duality of the universe for a moment.  Dark forest lies off in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD021 {...You're at the tree of the mockingbird.  This oddly shaped tree has been
naturally shaped into the likeness of a large bird, wings spread out, mouth
agape in a cry of the wild.  At the very top of the tree you can hear the
flutter of wings, an occasional glimpse of feathers, and the unmistakable
cry of the mockingbird.  The ground is splattered with excess bird remains.
Dark forest extends in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD022 {...You're on the banks of a lush lagoon.  To the north a sparkling, deep blue
sea flows out across the horizon.  You're on a beautiful, sandy shore which is
shaded by the boughs of overhanging cypress trees, which extend past the
shoreline and finally touch the water, their leaves floating gently on its
smooth surface.  As you gaze into the sparkling sea, a beautiful image of the
Goddess Tashanna appears in human form for a fleeting moment and then suddenly
transforms into a spectacular pegasus and flies away in the chimerical images
of the waves.  Dark forest lies off to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD023 {...You're in a natural chapel.  Truly a work of natural magic, this small
space in the forest has been shaped by the powers of the universe into a
breathtaking chapel dedicated to the Goddess Tashanna.  The most beautiful
assortment of tall trees, blooming flowers, and luscious bushes you have ever
seen grow in orchestrated harmony in the form of a protected, peaceful, and
enchanting sanction.  To the west, through a natural archway of oaks, lies
an altar, the dark forest extends off in all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD024 {...You're at a silver altar.  Enclosed by large, majestic oak trees, this
small alcove is illuminated by a beautiful, shining altar carved from pure
silver.  It's holy radiance fills your soul with peace and love, leaving you
breathless with joy.  The altar is surrounded by several lavender rose bushes,
their purplish pulchritude complimenting the brilliance of the altar.  The
only exit is an archway of oaks to the east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD025 {...You're in the Grove of Oaks.  These magnificent and majestic soldiers of
the forest stand tall and proud, rising above the forest in an aura of sheer
power and wisdom.  Something about their august presence fills your soul with
courage and determination.  As you glance around, a vision suddenly appears in
your mind of the Goddess Tashanna, who smiles at you warmly and whispers in
your ear: "No matter where you go, I will be with you...".  The vision then
vanishes as quickly as it had appeared.  Dark forest surrounds you in all
directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD026 {...You're in a cluster of ash trees.  Silent and solemn in their pose,
these ash trees are analogous to coffin bearers in mourning.  You can almost
feel the sorrow and regret these ancestral guardians of peace, who's realm
has been disturbed by a spreading pain or evil, which has destroyed the very
roots of their existence.  As you look around, you feel emotion swelling in
your soul, feeling sorry for the sorrow and pain of the world.  Dark forest
lies in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD027 {...You're near a strange, large rock.  This uniquely shaped boulder dominates
this small, dark clearing within the surrounding forest.  The ground is rather
damp and muddy, and the air is rather moist and muggy.  A faint, purplish mist
hovers around the base of the rock, creating an aura of divine mysticism.  The
sunlight which filters down through the surrounding trees creates fantastical
shadows, seeming to dance with their own souls.  Dark forest surrounds you in
all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD028 {...You're at an abandoned campsite.  This small clearing has the remains of
a campsite littered about its center.  Ashes from a fire, broken branches, and
trampled undergrowth mark this place as a once well-used base camp.  Written
on a nearby tree, apparently carved by a previous camper, is the phrase:
"Travel fast and travel far..."; the writing then ends abruptly.  Dark forest
lies off in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD029 {...You're on a plateau.  Rising slightly above the treeline of the forest,
this leveled peak of rocky grassland gives you an excellent view of the entire
region extending for miles in all directions.  Off to the northeast you can
see the sparkle of the sea, to the west a misty mountain range, and off in
all directions deep, dark forest.  The air is crisp and clean, and you feel
good to be alive.  A wooded hill slopes down to the east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD030 {...You're on a densely wooded hill.  Sloping steeply up to the west, this
hill is covered with tall pine trees and thick undergrowth.  You hear the
hum of bees in somewhere in one of the nearby pines, accompanied by the
rather annoying, although harmonious, chirping of birds.  The air seems to
become cleaner up to the west, and the base of this hill lies down to the
east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD031 {...You're at the base of a densely wooded hill.  A pine covered hill rises
up to the west, although densely overgrown.  Overhanging pine branches sweep
past your head in the intermittent gusts of air which blow down from the hill
to the west.  An odor of sweet flowers emanates from somewhere off to the
south, and you hear the faint rush of water off to the north.  For a moment,
as you look around, you get a feeling of loneliness.  Except for the rising
hill to the west, dark forest lies in all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD032 {...You're at a bubbling spring of water.  Crystal-clear water spouts from
the heavy undergrowth from a small, limestone fissure in the ground.  The
unmistakable scent of springwater fills your nostrils and brings a feeling
of freshness to your soul.  Blooming near this sparkling spray of water, a
beautiful, lavender rose bush flourishes colorfully.  Dark forest stretches
off in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD033 {...You're in a shady, natural shelter.  The boughs of the surrounding elm
trees have grown together, enclosing this small area into a protected, natural
shelter.  The dirt floor is covered with a layer of dry, fallen leaves.  No
sunlight is able to penetrate through the natural roof of this shelter, and
it is illuminated only by the reflections of the forest around it.  The air is
slightly humid and has an odor of decaying vegetation.  Dark forest continues
off in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD034 {...You're in the Druid's Circle.  This unparalleled spectacle of enchantment
is totally awe-inspiring, and your soul is filled with wonder.  Three silver
rings, encompassing the entire area, magically float in the air, stacked upon
each other.  They are surrounded by a wide circle of the largest and most
majestic oak trees you have ever laid eyes upon.  In the center of this
dazzling vortex is a brightly glowing orb of pure light, whose brilliance is
almost blinding.  You can feel the powerful presence of the goddess Tashanna
radiating throughout all of this mystical and holy sphere.  Dark forest lies
in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD035 {...You're at a terraced waterfall.  Gently flowing water tinkling down
layers of polished, purplish stone paint a majestic landscape before your
eyes.  A few rays of sunlight filter through the nearby forest growth to
glitter off the shallow, rushing water, sparkling with a holy radiance.  As
you behold this natural fascination, a surge of overwhelming emotions fills
your soul with a love beyond anything describable.  You notice an entrance
to a cave to the north and dark forest lies in all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD036 {...You're at a large, sparkling waterfall.  Rushing white water plunges down
this great cataract, sending sprays of cold spring water in all directions.
Perhaps the most august, magnificent, and inspiring scene of nature you have
ever witnessed, this majestic, sparkling cascade takes your breath away with
its sheer natural beauty.  This graceful torrent rushes down into a clear,
deep pool which flows into a surging stream that vanishes into the undergrowth
to the east.  Several assorted green plants have flourished in the rich soil
nearby, complemented by a few, blooming lavender rose bushes, all adding the
final touch of perfection to this heaven on earth.  You see a cavern behind
the falls to the north, an entrance to a cave to the west, and dark forest
to the south and east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD037 {...You're in a small clearing in a forest.  The sweet smell of springtime
drifts through the gentle breeze in this small, grassy clearing.  Dew drips
from the petals of the assorted flowers which are blooming freely here, and
the ground is soft and damp.  Above you, the sky is a beautiful, bright shade
of blue with fluffy, white clouds sailing smoothly across the horizon.  Your
soul feels at peace in this natural sanction.  Surrounding you in all
directions is a deep, green forest.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD038 {...You're near the Fountain of Eternal Magic.  Concealed for eons within
the depths of the surrounding dark forest, this enchanting and mystical jet
of shimmering, iridescent water rises grandly before you.  Rising from a
beautiful well, carved from the purest white marble, this resplendent wonder
radiates an aura of powerful sorcery, its glittering water inviting you to
drink its enticing ambrosia.  A splendid portrait of the Goddess Tashanna
has been inscribed in the base of this fountain along with an engraving
which reads "aeid treven alliw suoy irof levol yym ftub ayb tseog aemit
sdna issap lsdnegel y f".  Dark forest lies in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD039 {...You're near a platinum tree.  Yet another wonder of the world of the
Goddess Tashanna, before you rises a magnificent oak tree magically turned to
solid platinum, sparkling in the sunlight.  Even more awe-inspiring, however,
are the branches of this platinum beauty which have grown together in the
shape of a large heart, emanating an aura of powerful magic and love.  In
the mystical zephyrs which waft around this tree, you hear whispers of words
that you cannot clearly hear, but which bring peace to your soul.  Dark
forest surrounds you in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD040 {...You're in a small field of lilacs.  A breezy, sunlit opening within the
vast forest, this small field is alive with the grass and lilacs waving in
the gentle wind.  Without the tall trees of the forest obstructing too much
of your view, you can now discern large mountains, shrouded in purplish mists,
far off in the west.  You are also quite aware of the continuous buzzing of
assorted insects which swarm around you in this grassy clearing.  Dark forest
awaits you in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD041 {...You're at the Secret Shrine of Tashanna.  Hidden behind the plunging
cascade of water and covered in purplish mists, this sacred spot radiates an
aura of unmatched "good".  The shrine itself is in the shape of a unicorn,
carved from pure silver, which glitters in the spray of the waterfall,
shining in a holy brilliance that fills your soul with awe.  The rest of this
wizened cavern appears to have been carved from solid, unflawed amethyst,
which sparkles incandescently, dazzling you with its iridescence.  The only
exit is through the waterfall to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD042 {...You're near a large statue.  Located in the middle of dark forest, this
incredible work of art would be amazing if discovered within the finest art
gallery of Kyrandia, and far so lost deep in the center of a dark forest.
You feel a powerful urge to examine the statue more closely, and in your mind
you cannot help but to wonder about the nature of the artist who created this,
his inspiration and dedication.  Dark forest lies in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD043 {...You're at the entrance to a dark cave.  Before you rises a colossal
mountain cliff of solid granite with a small, dark hole at the base, leading
into a dark cave.  The ground is rather rocky, with assorted patches of grass
sprouting like oases in a desert of gray granite.  To the east, a large
waterfall thunders loudly, as a smaller, terraced waterfall flows off to the
south.  The cave entrance is to the north.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD101 {...You're in a dark forest.  Tall, ominous pine trees surround you, their
thick, bristly branches hanging down and making it difficult to proceed in
any direction.  Almost all of the sunlight is blocked out by the densely
packed trees, and the few rays which do filter down create dark, menacing
shadows which seem to dance along the leafy forest floor.  As you glance
around, you happen to notice a small shrine, almost completely hidden in
the underbrush.  You feel a tingle of excitement in your very heart and
soul.  It is very confusing to determine your exact location.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD170 {...You're in a dark cave.  This natural excavation in the granite of the
mountain is not very large.  The walls, floor, and ceiling of this dark hole
are jagged and uneven making it difficult to keep your balance.  The air is
extremely humid and water drips from the ceiling high above, creating an eerie
atmosphere to the entire place.  Sunlight finds its way in from the opening
to the south, and dark, twisting caverns wind off in all other directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD178 {...You're in a natural hall.  This long passageway has been smoothly carved
from the solid granite of this mountain, in contrast to the jagged caverns
to the south.  Oddly enough, there is a strong smell of sulfur in the air,
almost choking you with its strength.  This strange hall continues off into
the darkness to the north, from which a cold, eerie wind gently blows.  The
caverns twist off to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD179 {...You're at a bottomless chasm.  At the northern end of a great natural hall,
this wide, dark pit lies ominously before you, as though taunting you with its
impassibility.  There appears to be no way around this blockade; the ceiling
of this cavern is very high, the walks are smooth and slippery, and the
chasm expands from wall to wall and is at least twenty feet across.  Far on
the other side, you see a sparkling jade cavern, its beauty tempting you
almost mockingly.  There is a natural hall which continues off to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD180 {...You're in a jade cavern.  Multiple hues of beautiful jade sparkle around
you in this cavern of precious gems.  All the walls, floor, and ceiling of
this incredible natural chamber shine with their own incandescent light, their
combined brilliance lighting the surroundings in a holy, green aura.  A huge,
bottomless chasm blocks the way to the south, while a dark passage in the far
side of this lovely cavern leads off to the north.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD181 {...You're at a statue of Tashanna.  Before you rises a lovely sculptured
statue of the Goddess Tashanna, Lady of Legends.  It rises from an iron base
and extends up about eight feet to the ceiling of this smooth cavern.  A
beautifully carved marble path leads off to a large structure to the east.
You hear a distant thunder of rushing water off to the north, and from a dark
passageway to the south you see a faint glimmer of green light.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD182 {...You're near a reflecting pool.  This peaceful and delightful pool has been
ornately hand-carved from the purest marble.  The water of the pool is crystal
clear, and it sparkles in the light of this large cavern, reflecting a faint
image of you as you peer into it.  You also notice many intricate symbols at
the bottom of the pool, traced by pure gold, although you can identify none of
them.  A large, marble structure rises off to the east, while a marble path
leads to the west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD183 {...You're at the forgotten Pantheon of Tashanna.  Long lost within the depths
of this hidden underground city, this ancient temple of the Lady of Legends,
Tashanna, is perhaps the greatest legend of all Kyrandia.  Folklore of ages
past claim this spot to be the greatest pinnacle of the power of Tashanna.
Constructed from pure marble pillars embedded with mystical symbols of silver
and gold, and covered in purplish mists, this holy sanction radiates an aura
of eternal peace and love.  An odd-shaped marble archway lies to the east and
a reflecting pool is located to the west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD184 {...You're at the Portal of the Past.  Huge, marble archways line the entrance
to this relatively small marble chamber.  On the far side of this chamber a
shimmering, magical portal radiates with an enchanting, multi-chromatic light.
Many strange and wonderful visions flash through the portal, almost holding
you spellbound with their dancing, iridescent images.  Unfortunately, the
visions change so quickly, you can rarely catch more than a brief, blurry
flash.  The only exit appears to be the marble archways leading off to the
west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD185 {...You're in a smooth-walled alcove.  Dark and barren, this small, natural
chamber has few noticeable features.  The ceiling is about two feet above your
head, and is made of the same smooth and solid granite of the floor and walls.
The west side of this tiny cave has a noticeable, fist-sized crevice, and you
hear the faint rush of water from somewhere around you.  The only exit is to
the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD186 {...You're in a dark cave.  This damp, gloomy location is characterized only
by jagged rock covered with fungi and bacteria.  A dominating odor of decay
fills your nostrils making it difficult to breathe.  Your attention is caught
by a fancy, large machine sitting in the corner.  The only exit is a bright
passageway to the north.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD187 {...You're in a bright passageway.  This mystical hall appears to be pure
light, radiating in awe-inspiring brilliance all around you.  You feel as if
you are floating in mid-air.  There seem to be no boundaries as to where you
can go, however, you do notice what appear to be exits from this spectacular
wonder to the north and south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD188 {...You're at some misty ruins.  A thick layer of purplish mists blanket this
entire cavern; the mists are so smooth and beautiful, however, they almost
seem like a magical, royal carpet.  Shrouded within the mists, you see faint
glimpses of broken marble pillars, as though this was once some great temple.
In the center of this mysterious cavern, a bright blue orb of pure light
floats, mystically suspended in midair.  A strange feeling enters your very
soul, and an eerie wind seems to whisper as it blows across your face.  The
only exit is a bright passageway to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD189 {...You're on a sandy beach near the sea.  The beautiful, bright blue sea lies
to the south, where it seems to extend on forever, except for a few distant
mountain peaks across the sparkling water to the south.  The crashing of the
small waves on the wet sand near the water sounds like faraway thunder, which
conjures up strange memories of your early childhood.  The beach becomes more
grassy to the north.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD190 {...You're on a grassy beach.  Large clumps of long, soft grass cover almost
all of the sand of this little beach.  A gentle breeze blows from the south,
warm and salty, filling your lungs with clean, fresh air.  Beautiful, golden

sparkling, silver tulip bush blooms magically amongst the golden elm trees,
seeming to naturally blend in with this mystical fantasyland.  The enchanted
tulips are too numerous to count, their almost unending silver magic filling
your eyes with stars.  As rays of sunlight filter down, they're defracted by

fills your soul with the touch of love.  Golden forest lies off in all
directions.

KRD204 {...You're at the Gateway of the Rainbows.  Before your eyes rises the most
breathtakingly beautiful scene you have ever witnessed.  An incredible, large
archway of rainbows shines brilliantly, its vivid spectrum of colors almost
blinding you with awe.  Within the archway, an intricate assortment of "bars"
of rainbows create a shimmering gateway of beauty, which although lovely,
effectively block passage through them to the east.  Beyond the gateway, you
can only imagine what fantastical paradises thrive in heavenly sanction.
Golden forest lies off in all other directions.

prove your piety".  Golden forest lies off in all directions.

seemingly endless golden fantasyland, this silver altar is a magnificent
representation of the glory of Tashanna.  At the base of the altar, there is

of the forest seem especially soothing here.  Golden forest lies off in all
directions.

peaceful appearing picnic ground.  Golden forest lies off to the south,
and a barren desert is to the north.

KRD217 {...You're in a wasteland of decay.  This barren desert of death and decay
radiates an aura of sheer evil.  Even the air is stagnant and filled with the
odors of rotting waste.  The ground is hard, grey rock, and the sky is almost
as dark.  You feel a chilling fear in your heart, and the sudden urge to run
as fast as your feet can carry you.  A large mountain lies to the north, and
there is a grassy plain to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD218 {...You're at the Demon Gate.  Before you rises a huge mountain face of jagged
rock which extends high above your view.  Directly in front of you is what
appears to be the form of a gate, carved into the rock, and adorned with
elaborate figures of devils and demons.  In the center of this gate a small
niche lies noticeably empty, as though waiting for a key.  A barren wasteland
of decay lies to the south.

to the east and west, a larger hall to the south, and stairs leading
downward to the north.

KRD226 {...You're in an eroded storage closet.  This small and barren little room
was apparently once used for storage of food... or so you assume from the
smell of rotted provisions that hangs heavily in the air.  You happen to
notice something scraped into the western wall which reads, in a barely
decipherable script: "Time changes everything".  The only exit is a crumbling
hall to the east.

KRD227 {...You're in a small, stuffy alcove.  This room has many wooden pegs sticking
out from the eastern wall; you conclude this chamber was once used for storage

quantities of rat droppings fills the air,  driving you to uncontrollable
nausea... almost.  The only exit is a crumbling hall to the west.

evil lingers in the air, however, making you shiver with a twinge of fear.

finger on what... or can you?  A stinking, damp passageway leads off to the
north.

wall.  The only exit appears to be to the west.

to the north and south.  An ominous feeling of great magic tingles at your
soul here, from no apparently visible source.

KRD234 {...You're at a small, abandoned water well.  Before your eyes lies a
quaint, old water well constructed from beautiful, hand-carved red bricks.
It has an almost magical aura to it -- though simple in design -- and
you feel a strange sense of eternal peace as you lean near it.  You happen
to notice a small hole in the eastern wall which leads off into darkness.
The rest of this chamber seems to be crumbling like the other parts of
the basement.  A decaying, stone hall lies off to the south.

KRD235 {...You're in a dark, damp cavern.  You can barely see much in this near
pitch black hole, but you feel yourself on sturdy, though somewhat uneven,

water from the ceiling shrouded in darkness above you.  You see a definite
exit to the west, but the darkness prohibits you from determining what
other exits may exist.

KRD236 {...You're in an odd-shaped cave.  This chalky cavern seems to be lit by

by this mysterious mineral, you can see many strange, encrypted symbols,
which read: "Hqofowy asitpqnm ifqnpytuvc qotmay gioem loopas asit, illiada

west.

you find it difficult to observe any of the visible features of this cave.
However, from feeling your way around, you realize that the curved and
rocky walls seem to be made from sandstone-like rock, while the floor is
a very fine and dusty sand; you cannot reach the ceiling.  You cannot
see where any exits may lie, but you feel curves of the floor towards
the south and east.

KRD238 {...You're in a cavern of diamonds.  This magnificent natural beauty is
illuminated by the magical properties of the walls, floor, and ceiling of
this breathtaking chamber which seems to be carved from solid diamond.

seems to touch your soul as you examine your surroundings... a feeling
beyond expression with mortal words.  The only apparent exit is a dark
cave to the west.

halls continue separately to the north and west.

KRD245 {...You're in the Chamber of the Alchemist.  This large chamber is filled with

and covered in a rather thick layer of dust.  An eerie green light filters
down from the oddly shaped ceiling above you.  The only exit is to the west.

KRD246 {...You're in the Chamber of the Lavender Rose.  This gracefully designed
chamber tells a pictorial history of the lavender roses of Kyrandia.  You
see a lovely mural of the Lady Kyra declaring the lavender rose as the
official symbol of the Kingdom of Kyrandia.  Another beautiful mural portrays
the Goddess Tashanna creating the lavender rose, taking a plain white rose
and touching it with her Wand of Rainbows.  You cannot help but smile at
the sight of such magic.  The only exit is to the east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD247 {...You're in a northeast hall.  This marble hall is decorated with a
beautiful mural on the ceiling which portrays the quests of many great
heroes.  As you examine it closely, you can recognize a few of the names
such as Corvus Andromeda, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Anastasia the Beautiful,
and many others... even a picture of the horrible bastard, The Enchanter.
Chambers lie to the east and west, and the hall continues to the north
and south.

KRD248 {...You're in the Chamber of the Gateway.  This majestic chamber of the
history of Kyrandia has been uniquely decorated with the story of the magical
Gateway of Rainbows in the golden forest.  A dazzlingly colorful painting on
the ceiling displays the wondrous fantasyland which lies beyond the brilliant
hues of the Gateway itself.  Various murals on the walls describe the legends
of the Gateway... how only two people of pure heart and soul may pass beyond
its majestic arches.  The only exit from this chamber appears to be to the
west.

KRD249 {...You're in the Chamber of Sir Alexis.  This beautifully decorated chamber
of the pictorial history of Sir Alexis, is filled with an air of greatness and
honor... like the great knight himself.  Artistic paintings of this knight's
many wonderful deeds portray a vital aspect of the history of Kyrandia -- the
romantic order of knighthood.  The knights of Kyrandia fought for the cause
of good, to defend righteousness, and to represent the glory of the Goddess
Tashanna and the wise ruler of the kingdom, the beautiful Lady Kyra.  You
are amazed at the life-like quality of the artwork.  The only exit appears

and a masterpiece depiction of the Bard's Carnival, the magical and musical
event of each Kyrandian century.  The halls lead off to the west and south.

KRD251 {...You're in a silver hall.  Everything, from the paint on the wall to the
silver inscriptions on the floor to the intricate silver chandelier hanging
above is made of silver.  The inscriptions are a replica of an ancient
document from long ago, which read: "By the glory of the Goddess Tashanna,
I swear my eternal loyalty to the Lady Kyra and the defense of the Kingdom
of Kyrandia.  Across time and space, Lord Alexis, Knight of the Lavender
Rose, Champion of the Lady of the Kingdom."  Each silver letter seems
to sparkle with something special, touching your heart with patriotism for
this wonderful land.  The hall continues to the east and west.

KRD252 {...You're in the Hall of Music.  This entire chamber reverberates with the
beautiful sound of one of the ancient romantic songs of Kyrandia past.  It
goes like this:  "I live my life in a fantasy land, dreaming of the day when
I'll win your hand.  Every breath I take, every beat of my heart, my love
grows for you as it has from the start.  Sing me a song of a fairy tale, a
story of our magic love.  Whisper the lyrics in my ear, you're the one I've
been dreaming of.  All the knights of legends past can't match my love for
you.  I'd sail the golden seas of fantasy and chase the stars for you.
Legends pass, but I will still love you.  You are my paradise, my dream come
true.  Heaven is in your arms, lying next to you.  Lady of legends, my dream's
confirmation; queen of a world of my imagination.  The world of reality
believes legends are gone, yet looking in your eyes I see legends live on.
If I could freeze the hands of time for just one day, I'd ask you to come
with me and sail far away.  Across our rainbow, hand in hand together, living
a legend and loving forever.  Legends pass and time goes by but my love for
you will never die, 'cause you are my legend come true, legend come true..."

KRD253 {...You're in the Hall of Memories.  From the moment you first step into
this room, your mind is suddenly filled with memories of times, places,
and people of your past.  Some are good and happy, while others are so
powerfully filled with sorrow and grief, you almost faint from all the
emotional pain that surges within your heart.  Truly, this is one of the
strangest of all of the remaining chambers of the fortress under the
mountain.  You may leave to the east or west.

KRD254 {...You're in the Hall of LadyHawk.  Dedicated years ago to the great
Lady of the Hawks, who helped to save the kingdom in the Battle of the
Great Dragons in the Third Age of Kyrandia, this chamber, unfortunately,

here.  However, you still have a dim memory of the beautiful memories

KRD256 {...You're in the Chamber of the Champion.  As you glance around this
incredible chamber, you are left awe-struck with the sheer magnificence

KRD257 {...You're in the Chamber of the Lady.  This magical chamber is covered
with lovely paintings of the legendary Lady Kyra.  This was her room,
created with love and care by the finest architects of the entire kingdom.
However, it is now dark and empty... the lady, like all the other fantastic
beauties of Kyrandia, has vanished.  Questions in your mind: "Is she gone
forever?" "Can this world ever live again?" "What IS the power of true
love?".  Only time will tell.  You may leave to the east.

down the back of your neck, leaving you shivering in sorrow.  You may go
in any direction.

KRD259 {...You're in the Chamber of the Bard.  This splendidly decorated room is
filled with murals of the history of the many great bards, including the most
famous of all, Brin.  Enscribed in golden gothic letters are some of the
lyrics of one of his more popular songs, "Fairy Tales", which read:

 If you believe in magic, or wish upon a star...
 Then fantasy can touch your life, no matter who you are
 It doesn't matter how old you are, or if you're rich or poor
 Your imagination is the key that opens any door...

 And nothing is impossible, if only you believe...
 Once you find your dreamworld, you'll never want to leave
 You can ride a winged horse high into the skies...
 And as reality fades away your spirit starts to rise

As you read the inscriptions, a beautiful melody runs through your mind,
sending a tingle through your soul.  The only exit appears to be to the west.

including the ancient truth, "Love is a power beyond all magic".  The only
visible exit is to the east.

KRD261 {..You're in the Chamber of Poetry.  This small room was once used to
glorify some of the greatest poets and poems of the kingdom of Kyrandia.
However, it too has long been deserted, but one last poem remains carved
on the otherwise barren stone floor.  The poem reads:

  Through the looking glass I spied

  Bewildered and mystified
  In her forest, against the world
  All alone in her fantasy forest

helpless.  That's life for you!  Speaking of helpless, I hope you ARE
aware that there is a very large and very nasty dragon searching to

heavens to this dreamworld come true, stepping down on plateaus made of pure
emerald.  At the bottom of this jeweled cataract, an enchanting, crystal clear
pool has formed in serene harmony with this enchanting place of legends.  The
air is filled with the sweet aroma of the surrounding lavender rose bushes

as well as large globs of blood stains, are everywhere, mandating the evil
which has taken over this cold, grey place.  You can exit to the east and
west if you wish, or you can just choose to stay here and rot like everything
else.

KRD287 {...You're in a hall.  The hall continues to the east and west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD288 {...You're in the Chamber of the Heart.  This particular room has a certain
warmth to it, setting your spirit to peace.  Nothing spectacular seems to
catch your attention, except for an inscription on the west wall, which
reads: "Commitment of the heart strengthens the soul."  The only exits are
to the north and east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD289 {...You're in a crumbling centre.  This intersection of four chambers is
slowly being destroyed by the decay of time.  Once long, long ago this
chamber was cared for and loved, but now it has been abandoned and left
to waste away into oblivion.  There are chambers in all directions.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD290 {...You're in the Chamber of Eternal Magic.  If this magical room once
contained any powerful sorcery, it has long since been destroyed.  You
notice a roughly carved inscription in the far wall which read: "Nothing
is Eternal".  You find your soul void of any and all feelings in this
strangely familiar location, and you feel yourself growing weak and faint.
You cannot help but contemplate the peace of death.  The only exit is to
the west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD291 {...You're in the Chamber of the Soul.  This mystical room strikes you with
complete awe.  As you look around, everything seems to extend forever, in
an infinitely large universe... with no boundaries.  Far in the distance
billions of stars glimmer as whole galaxies grow and die before your eyes.
Within your vision, you are witnessing eternity... beyond any and all
mortal limitations.  You feel the rush of time passing by, oblivious to all
things of physical nature.  Doorways of light are exits to the south and east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD292 {...You're in a barren hall.  Except for the dirty and worn marble floor,
walls, and ceiling, there is nothing else of interest.  Looking at such
total emptiness makes you only more aware of the sheer desolation of this
once dreamy fantasy world.  Emotions of remorse, hopelessness, and plain
disgust fill your heart, soul, mind, and body.  The hall continues to the
east and west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD293 {...You're in the chamber of the magic orb.  In the center of this room,
floating high in the air, is the fading silhouette of a once great orb.
Perhaps long ago it was a materialized reality, but now it has faded to
a mere quasi-real image.  Your hand passes freely through it, and it seems
oblivious to your existence.  Nothing really remains of this ancient
magic... like everything in Kyrandia, this fantasy seems to be dying too.
The only exit from this room is a crumbling archway to the east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD294 {...You're in the Chamber of Hidden Magic.  This room, like most wonderful
things in life, is only a dream.  It doesn't exist.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD295 {...You're in the Chamber of Life.  This is a dimly lit room, with a somber
ambiance and a low hum that emanates from deep within.  The floor is made of
the purest white marble, and placed exactly in the center of the room is an
unadorned altar.  Exits lie to the north and south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD296 {...You're in a beautiful, small chapel.  Oh, how lovely this religious
chamber appears to your worldly eye... all delicate and "good" amongst the
chaos of reality.  The silver altar on the far side (don't bother looking,
it doesn't have an extra description) is tarnished, something that you notice
with considerable irony -- after all, it is the holy focus of the WONDERFUL
Goddess Tashanna.  You look around and suddenly realize: this world is no
longer a living fantasy, but instead a cold, grey world, long forgotten by
it's patron goddess.  You feel the desire to leave; the exit is to the west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD297 {...You're at a hidden, emerald shrine.  This fantasy room does not
exist.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD298 {...You're in the Hall of the Royal Knights.  Before your eyes lies yet
another "great" hall of this kingdom under the mountain.  You smirk as
you glance at its gothic architecture, again, made mostly from marble
like everything else in this forgotten realm.  You spit on the floor in
disgust.  At your last glance, you also notice a triangular rune in the
center of the floor.  Words inscribed beside it say, "Patience, wisdom,
and faith are the devotions of fools".  Plain, old exits lead to the
north, south, and east.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD299 {...You're in the Hall of the Throne.  Constructed from the purest of marble,
in a Gothic-style architecture, this beautiful hall served as both a greetings
chamber for those who came to see the Lady Kyra and a feasting hall for any
special royal banquets or other such events.  Once alive with activity, it
now lies empty
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD300 {...You're in the royal kitchen.  This rather large room was once used to
prepare the great feasts and banquets for the Lady Kyra and her guests.  Now,
however, it lies barren and deserted, as if some horrible evil had vanquished
the good magic that once thrived here.  A strong odor of sulfur floats from
the northern wall.  The Hall of the Throne lies to the west.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD301 {...You're in the throne chamber.  Once the great hall where the Lady Kyra
herself ruled the Kingdom of Kyrandia, this Gothic-style chamber has been
trashed by some unknown force.  The walls and floor have large cracks in
them, dust and debris cover everything, and anything of value has long since
been looted by  thieves.  You also notice a huge hole in the northern wall,
beyond which lies a pitch-black darkness.  A evil stench of death and decay
emanates from that hole.  The Hall of the Throne lies to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD302 {...You're in the lair of the dragon.  This dark, gloomy cave radiates an aura
of incredible evil.  The darkness hides almost all the features of this large,
ragged cavern, but the distinctive odor of dragon waste identifies this place
as a lair of a dragon.  A chill of fear runs through your blood and your heart
beats fast as the effects of dragonfear overcome you.  The throne chamber lies
to the south.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD303 {...You're in the Forest of Fantasy.
} T Kyrandia locations text


KRD304 {...You're at the Waterfall of Fantasy.  Shrouded here in purplish mists lies
the most awe-inspiring wonderment of the magic of Tashanna... the mystical
Waterfall of Fantasy.  Before you, rising high into the clouds, this majestic
cascade of beautifully clear water sparkles flamingly as it rushes from the
heavens to this dreamworld come true, stepping down on plateaus made of pure
emerald.  At the bottom of this jeweled cataract, an enchanting, crystal clear
pool has formed in serene harmony with this enchanting place of legends.  The
air is filled with the sweet aroma of the surrounding lavender rose bushes
and the melodious music of songbirds singing in joy.  In the sky, night and
day, shines the brightest rainbow you've ever seen... and floating above it
are golden letters which read: "ATASILYF".  The Forest of Fantasy lies to
the west.
