INTROA {
Welcome, brave and adventurous one, to the wondrous and magical game of
Kyrandia, Fantasy World of Legends!!  You are about to journey to a fantasy
land far, far away... a land of swords and sorcery where the only limit is
your own imagination.

You will travel to the world of Kyrandia, a fairy tale land of magic and
mystery, realm of the beautiful and powerful goddess of Kyrandia, Tashanna,
the "Lady of Legends."  Here, you begin as a young apprentice from a small
village who seeks to grow in knowledge, wisdom, and power, with high hopes
of being granted the title of "Arch-Mage of Legends" -- the mightiest wizard
of Kyrandia!  To achieve your goal, you must cross the lands of Kyrandia,
face unknown perils, solve mystical enigmas, battle rivalrous mages, and
conqueror your own mind, body, and soul.

Time has stood still for too long on Kyrandia -- now is the time for one
mage to rise above and master the powers of sorcery and magic.

INTROB {
However, before you begin your adventure, here's a brief explanation of how
to play:

Kyrandia is a multi-player interactive game, where many people at once can
adventure with each other in the same simulated adventure world.  Players
can help one another, engage in battle, trade information, or just "shoot the
breeze."

To move about in Kyrandia, type the direction you want your character to go
(north, south, east or west).  You can speak with other players using action
verbs.  For example, if you were to type "say hello there", other players at
the same location would see "hello there."  You may pick up objects and do
things with them.  You can look at your current surroundings or other players.
Almost any mundane action you can think of can be performed.

However, the world of Kyrandia is much, much more.  The underlying theme of
the entire game is the use of magic.  Similar in concept to the popular
role-playing game "Dungeons & Dragons," players are "magic-users" who start
at level 1 (Apprentice) and advance to higher levels and more powerful magic.

Press RETURN to continue} T Kyrandia description


INTROC {
Although you must be the one to discover all the details (and many there are)
of the magic of Kyrandia, we'll give you a little help to start off with.

Spells are magic cast by players, sometimes at objects or other players.  To
cast a spell a player must first have it memorized.  He must also have
enough spell points to cast it, and must be of high enough level for certain
spells.  Also, some spells require the player to have certain components
(objects) to cast them.  To actually cast the spell, a player must type
"cast" and then the secret incantation of the spell to be cast; sometimes,
a direct object must be included as well, such as "at the elf".

The physical strength and endurance of a player is determined by his "hit
points."  A player's hit points increase as he gains levels or by magical
means.  It is through hit points that most players battle each other; when a
player's hit points reach 0, he is killed, and must start from scratch at the
beginning again.

To see what spells you have memorized and how many spell points you have,
type "spells".  To see how many hit points you have, type "hits".  To see
what objects you are holding, type "inv".  And if you need it, type "help".

Press RETURN to continue} T Kyrandia description


INTROD {
You may ask what great treasure lies in this adventure?  You will run
across many exciting characters and travel through breathtaking scenery.
Beyond that, explore this great world to find what is hidden for you.  The
first player to reach the end will be granted the title of "Arch-Mage of
Legends."

Kyrandia is based upon a complete Fantasy World created by Scott Brinker; it
was programmed by Scott Brinker and Richard Skurnick in March-June of 1988,
and is based on multi-player interactive game concepts originated by Tim
Stryker.  Also, thanks are due to those who gave the support and inspiration
to make this fantasy a reality.  Kyrandia is dedicated to the lonely souls
of the world; type "help fantasy" in the game for more.

Enjoy the magic, mystery, and mirth of Kyrandia, Fantasy World of Legends!

HLPCOM {...Suddenly, a small elf runs out from nowhere!  He gives you a nod and a
smile and whispers in your ear...

 Kyrandia is a multi-player fantasy adventure.  You can speak with other
 players using action verbs.  For example, if you were to type "say hello
 there", other players at the same location would see "hello there."

 You can move around the large world of Kyrandia by telling the computer
 which direction you wish to go (example: west).  You can abbreviate these
 commands for your convenience: n(orth), s(outh), e(ast), and w(est).  In
 some instances, you can also use special commands too (example: climb the
 tree).  Also, it is rumored travel can be done magically as well!

 You can pick up objects and use them in assorted ways (you can experiment
 for yourself).  Also, for added novelty, you can do numerous "mundane"
 actions, such as: smile, laugh, kick <Player-ID>, wink, hug <Player-ID>,
 and many more!

 The rest you have to figure out on your own!  Good luck!

The elf then bows swiftly to you and disappears in a puff of smoke!

HLPFAN {

 It has taken over two years to fully visualize this Fantasy World of
 Kyrandia, a mirror-image of a dreamworld inspired by love and fashioned
 by imagination.  Created with smiles and tears, hopes and fears, and a
 passion of the soul immeasurable by mortal definitions, Kyrandia holds
 a magic beyond sorcery; a magic that will bloom like the lavender roses
 of Kyrandia across time and space forever... love.  This entire work is
 dedicated to my Lady of Legends, the one who dances eternally in my
 dreams; forever alive in my heart and soul, beyond reality, but never
 beyond imagination and hope, over the rainbow, in the fantasy forest where
 wishes come true and the emeralds sparkle in the waterfall forever more.

 Although Kyrandia is an adventure game, filled with action, excitement,
 and interaction, I ask you to also take some time amongst the casting of
 fireballs and battling of monsters to examine the scenery of Kyrandia
 and delve into the deeper meanings of this visionary Fantasy World.

 Thank you so much for partaking in this humble world of mine.  I wish
 you the best of luck, in Kyrandia, and in everything in life.  Farewell.

        Scott James Brinker
    (fantasy author/programmer)

HLPGOL {...As you ask for a help, a genie suddenly pops out in a cloud of smoke,
smiles, and says to you...

 Welcome to Kyrandia!  I'm so pleased and honored to have you in my humble
 world.  Thank you so, so much for joining this wonderful fantasy land!

 However, you wish to know about gold, huh?  Well, as you've probably
 already concluded, gold is the currency of Kyrandia, similar to the
 "dollar" of your original world.  You can use gold to buy things from
 the many different people you will meet in Kyrandia, or for other,
 more arcane purposes.

 To get gold, well, you have to get it the hard way -- find it.  Or, if
 you're a good alchemist, you might be able to make it?  Ah, well that's
 up to you to discover.  If you're having trouble finding gold out in the
 vast wilderness of Kyrandia, you could always try and get a job.  Rumor
 has it many village store keepers are always looking for good adventurers.

 Anyway, hope I've been of some assistance, but I have to run for now.  Have
 a great time, and I bid you well on all your adventures in Kyrandia!

The genie disappears in a flash of forked, blue lightning!

HLPHIT {...As you make your request for some aid, an old, wise man suddenly appears
before you, gives you a small grin, and says...

 "Hit points" are the representation of your character's strength, health,
 and endurance.  When your hit points reaches zero, your character dies.
 As you grow in power (gain levels) your number of hit points increase.

 You combat with people through the use of magic, ultimately to bring their
 hit points to zero.  You can use spells or magical items, but the result is
 usually the same.  However, if you wish to be really slick, you can also
 attack people in other ways besides lowering their hit points -- I'll leave
 it up to you to discover how...

 You can also combat with the many different creatures of Kyrandia, but you
 best beware: their power is often way beyond your magic!

 When a character dies, he (or she) is automatically restarted at the very
 beginning of the game, near the willow tree, at level 1.

The old man then gives you a respectful bow and vanishes in a puff of smoke,
but not before grinning to himself.
} T Kyrandia description


HLPLEV {...As you call out for help, a flash of incredibly bright light blinds you!
***
Before you stands the Goddess Tashanna, shining in sheer beauty.  She kisses
your check and says...

 Your power is measured in "levels" in Kyrandia, which determine how many
 "hit points" you have, how many "spell points" you have, and how powerful
 of spells you may cast.  You gain 2 spell points per level, and you gain
 4 hit points per level.  (see "help spells" and "help hits").  Each level
 also has a "title", or name, associated with it.  For example, when you
 start at level 1, you are titled "Apprentice"; to win the game, you must
 become an "Arch-Mage of Legends".  (see "help winning").

 It is up to you to discover exactly how many levels there are, and their
 respective titles.  However, everyone wears a "Patch of Sorcery" which
 declares their title (type "look <so-and-so>").  You may also look at
 yourself to admire your own title too.

 Above all else, remember... some things are more powerful than magic!

***
The Goddess Tashanna then smiles at you, and vanishes in a purple flash!
} T Kyrandia description


HLPSPE {...A tall, ominous wizard dressed in deep blue robes suddenly appears before
you in a column of orange flame!  He bows to you and begins to speak...

 Kyrandia is a world of magic.  To become powerful in Kyrandia, you therefore
 must master the art of spellweaving.

 The spell system of Kyrandia works like this: every player has a "spellbook"
 in which he keeps the spells he can memorize; no one can steal this
 book, and the player cannot lose it.  Once a spell is in the spellbook, a
 player may memorize that spell (type: memorize <spell name>).  You can have
 up to ten spells "memorized" at the same time.  A player then may cast any
 spell he has memorized (type: cast <spell name>).  Some spells also
 require a direct object (a target), such as a person, place, or thing; the
 direct object should be placed right after the spell name when being cast.
 Also note that some spells require certain components (objects) or other
 special circumstances to be successfully cast.

 You must also be of a certain level to cast different spells; the most
 powerful spells can only be cast by those of high enough level.

***
The wizard then bows and vanishes into thin air!
} T Kyrandia description


HLPWIN {...An image of the author, Scott Brinker, appears in a shimmering circle of
rainbows!  He smiles and says...

 To "win" Kyrandia, you must master the magic of this world and gain the title
 of "Arch-Mage of Legends".  Upon reaching this high level, you are eligible
 to collect any prize the System Operator of this realm may be offering.  The
 game will notify you of how to collect your prize and glory.  Let it be
 known that only the FIRST player to solve Kyrandia (on this system) may be
 the one to receive the prize.

 However, everyone who takes part in the experience of Kyrandia can win; if
 not a materialistic award of credits, then many hours of enjoyable gaming,
 the thrill of magical Dungeons & Dragons combat, and special insight into a
 dreamworld created from true love -- an enchanting, parallel fantasy of the
 world of reality in which we all live.

 I'm sorry, but I can't give you any "hints" or "solutions", because after
 all, that would take away all the excitement and adventure I've created for
 you!  However, I do suggest you see with your heart as well as your eyes...

He then shakes your hand, smiles again, and vanishes in his iridescent circle
of rainbows.
